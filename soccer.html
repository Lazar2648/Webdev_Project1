  	<h1>Soccer</h1>
  	<p>Soccer is my biggest passion. My passion for soccer comes from my dad and my older brother. I have played in multiple clubs in multiple countries throughout my life and currently I am a part of the mens soccer team here at IIT. I am also a life long Arsenal supporter.</p>
  	<h2>Soccer Career:</h2>
  	<ul>
      <li>WKS Slask Wroclaw - This was the first club I was a part of that is worth mentioning. I joined the team in 2013 and stayed there all the way until 2020. Therefore, a large part of my life revolved around this club.</li>

      <li>FC Stade-Lausanne Ouchy - After moving to Switzerland I had to say goodbye to WKS and find myself a new team. After a couple of trials in different clubs, I ended up in FC Stade-Lausanne Ouchy. I faced a couple of challenges, the biggest one being the early language barrier, due to everyone speaking french. However, after some time has passed I was able to form connections with my teammates and excel in my new role.</li>
